This script takes a molecule in the form of a smiles string and tries to draw it using turtle graphics. It is currently limited to molecules with a single hexagonal ring and at most carbon atoms with a valence of 3

Requirements:
This package requires the pysmiles package to parse smiles strings. It can be found [here](https://github.com/pckroon/pysmiles)
